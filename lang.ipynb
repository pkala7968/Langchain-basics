      "Python is a versatile and widely used programming language known for its readability and ease of use. However, like any language, it has its strengths and weaknesses. Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Readability and Simplicity:** Python's syntax is designed to be clear and easy to understand, resembling plain English. This makes it easier to learn, write, and maintain code.  It emphasizes code readability with its use of indentation.\n",
      "*   **Large and Active Community:** Python has a massive and supportive community of developers. This means you can easily find help online, access a wealth of tutorials, and benefit from the collective knowledge of experienced programmers.\n",
      "*   **Extensive Libraries and Frameworks:** Python boasts a vast collection of libraries and frameworks for various tasks, including:\n",
      "    *   **Data Science:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch\n",
      "    *   **Web Development:** Django, Flask\n",

This translates to improved functional strength and mobility.\\n*   **Hormonal Response:** Heavy compound exercises like squats can stimulate the release of anabolic hormones (testosterone, growth hormone), which can contribute to muscle growth and overall strength gains.\\n*   **Versatile:** Squats can be modified in various ways (e.g., back squat, front'"

      "Summary: Elon Reeve Musk  ( EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a businessman. He is known for his leadership of Tesla, SpaceX, X (formerly Twitter), and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk has been considered the wealthiest person in the world since 2021; as of May 2025, Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$424.7 billion. \n",
      "Born to a wealthy family in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk emigrated in 1989 to Canada. He received bachelor's degrees from the University of Pennsylvania in 1997 before moving to California, United States, to pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software company Zip2. Following its sale in 1999, he co-founded X.com, an online payment company that later merged to form PayPal, which was acquired by eBay in 2002. That year, Musk also became an American citizen.\n",
      "In 2002, Musk founded the space technology company SpaceX, becoming its CEO and chief engineer; the company has since led innovations in reusable rockets and commercial spaceflight. Musk joined the automaker Tesla as an early investor in 2004 and became its CEO and product architect in 2008; it has since become a leader in electric vehicles. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI to advance artificial intelligence research but later left; growing discontent with the organization's direction and their leadership in the AI boom in the 2020s led him to establish xAI. In 2022, he acquired the social network Twitter, implementing significant changes and rebranding it as X in 2023. His other businesses include the neurotechnology company Neuralink, which he co-founded in 2016, and the tunneling company the Boring Company, which he founded in 2017. Musk was the largest donor in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, and is a supporter of global far-right figures, causes, and political parties.  In early 2025, he served as senior advisor to United States president Donald Trump and as the de facto head of DOGE. \n",
      "Musk's political activities, views, and statements have made him a polarizing figure, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation and promoting conspiracy theories, and affirming antisemitic, racist, and transphobic comments. His acquisition of Twitter was controversial due to a subsequent increase in hate speech and the spread of misinformation on the service. His role in the second Trump administration attracted public backlash, particularly in response to DOGE.\n",

      "Having been first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, around 75% of Musk's wealth was derived from Tesla stock in November 2020. Describing himself as \"cash poor\", he became the first person in the world to have a net worth above $300 billion a year later. By December 2024, he became the first person to reach a net worth of $400 billion.\n",

Having rejected the conservative label, Musk has described himself as a political moderate; his views have become more right-wing over time, and have been characterized as libertarian and far-right. As the owner of Twitter, he has suppressed critics, and after his involvement in European politics, his views have received criticism from some world leaders. Musk has also expressed his opinion on topics from science and technology to religion and philosophy.\n",
